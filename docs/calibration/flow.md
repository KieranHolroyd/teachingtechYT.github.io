## Slicer Flow Calibration

### Aim:

To determine the correct amount filament to be extruded by the 3D printer as directed by the slicer.

### When required:

Base calibration, as well as any time there has been a change to the extruder/hot end. You may wish to revisit this after tuning linear advance.

### Tools:

Your favourite slicer. [Accurate digital/vernier calipers](https://amzn.to/3h62loN) (two decimal places is much more preferable to a set with only one).

Our E-steps are now correct in the firmware, so we will move on to calibrating the slicer. Each slicer has a setting to control the overall amount of filament extruded by the printer. If the flow rate is increased, more filament will be extruded. If the flow rate is decreased, less filament will be extruded.

In Simplify3D and PrusaSlicer, this is called **Extrusion Multiplier**. Cura calls it **Flow**.

My method of determining the correct flow rate is to print a hollow, single wall cube with a specified wall thickness, then measure the actual thickness of the wall and adjust the flow rate in the slicer to suit.

Some people prefer to have multiple walls and measure them together. For example, if the extrusion width was **0.4mm** with two perimeters, then you would be hoping to measure **0.8mm** for the cube wall. This does introduce more variables, such as the amount of perimeter overlap, and therefore a risk of the process failing. This is why I personally prefer a single wall cube, but each to their own.

Unfortunately, I can't provide pre-sliced gcode for this process. It is vital to use gcode generated by _YOUR_ slicer. Setting up your slicer to print the cube in the right way should be simple by following these steps:

### Special note:

Some other factors may affect the accuracy of the result.

Some slicers have a minimum layer time, which on a fast print like this, may slow down the feedrate significantly and alter the wall thickness. You may disable this in the slicer, but if your part cooling system is insufficient, the walls may become very hot and deform.

To overcome this, you may scale up the X and Y dimensions of the cube. As long as the file is sliced as described above, the wall thickness will not alter from this change in scale and the test will be valid.

Now slice and print!

## Interpreting Results:

Use digital/vernier callipers to measure the outer wall thickness of the hollow cube. Take measurements in multiple places/sides and average them. You may wish to cut/tear off the lower and upper layers of the cube. This is to remove portions with elephant's foot and/or other abnormalities.

If your measurement is _significantly_ off, the following calculator can then be used to calculate the new flow rate:

## Important note!

What you see with your eyes is more important than a theoretical calculation. After you have performed this calibration, please adjust the flow rate higher or lower based on what you actually see.

For example, the cube shown in the thumbnail of the [XYZ 20mm calibration cube by iDig3Dprinting](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278865):

[![](img/xyzcube.jpg)](#)

This print shows clear signs of under extrusion. There are gaps in the top infill as well as gaps between the perimeters and infill. Despite what any calibration procedure determined, the flow rate for this slicer/printer combination needs to be increased.

[This article on all3DP](https://all3dp.com/2/over-extrusion-3d-printing-tips-and-tricks-to-solve-it/) has examples of what over extrusion looks like.

## Can I use this flow value in the other tests on this site? - Important!

The short answer is: not really.

The gcode generators on this site work by using javascript to modify source gcode originally created by Simplify3D. However, when you completed the calibration test above, you sliced your own gcode, making your own baseline and then making a flow adjustment relative to that. Therefore, this test is unique from the others on this site which is why the flow rate doesn't necessarily translate.

Let's say your old flow rate was 100% and you have tested and corrected this to 96%. The gcode on this site originally had a flow rate of 90% when sliced, so applying your 96% to that gives a final result of 86.4%, not 96%. Your slicer profile settings will also be different in other ways, which further complicates matters. Therefore, there is not a straightforward correlation between your slicer and my gcode generators.

The aim of the site is to discover ideal settings you can apply to your own slicer profile, not to optimise the gcode created by the generators. Keep this in mind and focus on the aim of each test, rather than the general print quality.

If you are experiencing significant over or under extrusion that prevents you from using the tests properly, by using the custom start gcode function on this site you can optionally issue an [M221](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M221.html) to override the values in the generatored gcode. For example, using **M221 S90** would tell the firmware to only extrude 90% of what the gcode asks for. This is an easy method for making a quick correction that will alow the tests to complete successfully.
